# **Building Applications with Vector Databases**

## **Course Overview**  
This course teaches how to leverage vector databases like **Pinecone** to build six powerful applications. You'll explore how to use **embeddings** for similarity measurement, perform **semantic search**, and enhance **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **large language models (LLMs)**. The focus is on building AI-driven applications with minimal coding, giving you hands-on experience in vector search techniques.

### **What Youâ€™ll Learn**  
- Build six real-world applications using vector databases.  
- Implement **hybrid search** combining text and images.  
- Develop a **facial similarity ranking** system.  

### **Key Applications Covered**  
1. [**Semantic Search**](https://github.com/michaWorku/Building-Applications-with-Vector-Databases/blob/main/L1_Semantic_Search.ipynb) â€“ Improve search by retrieving results based on meaning instead of keywords.  
2. [**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**](https://github.com/michaWorku/Building-Applications-with-Vector-Databases/blob/main/L2_Retrieval_Augmented_Generation.ipynb) â€“ Enhance LLM responses using external knowledge sources.  
3. [**Recommender System**](https://github.com/michaWorku/Building-Applications-with-Vector-Databases/blob/main/L3_Recommender_Systems.ipynb) â€“ Suggest relevant content by combining semantic search and RAG.  
4. [**Hybrid Search**](https://github.com/michaWorku/Building-Applications-with-Vector-Databases/blob/main/L4_Hybrid_Search.ipynb) â€“ Perform multimodal search using both text and images.  
5. [**Facial Similarity**](https://github.com/michaWorku/Building-Applications-with-Vector-Databases/blob/main/L5_Facial_Similarity_Search.ipynb) â€“ Rank faces based on feature similarity.  
6. [**Anomaly Detection**](https://github.com/michaWorku/Building-Applications-with-Vector-Databases/blob/main/L6_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb) â€“ Identify unusual patterns in network logs.  

By the end of this course, you'll be equipped to build AI-powered applications using vector databases. ðŸš€
